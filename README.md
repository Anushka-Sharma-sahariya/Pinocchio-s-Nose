# Pinocchio's Nose: Digital Wellbeing Solution
## Overview
Pinocchio's Nose is a comprehensive online wellbeing platform designed to detect various forms of manipulated or inappropriate content. Named after the famous character whose nose grew when he lied, this project aims to identify "digital lies" in the form of deepfakes, AI-generated images, and inappropriate audio content.
## üöÄ Key Features
### 1. Pinocchio's Nose: Deepfake Image Detection
> [!NOTE]
> The Resnet50 Model is hosted on **Hugging Faceü§ó** for easy loading and deployment. [**View**](https://huggingface.co/krimson1/Resnet50_deepfake_detection)

## Project Structure:
- **[ResNet50_Training.ipynb](https://github.com/Visheshh21/Pinocchio-s-Nose/blob/main/ResNet50_Training.ipynb)**  
  Trains a ResNet50 model on an image dataset to detect AI-generated or deepfake content.

- **[Resnet50_Usage.ipynb](https://github.com/Visheshh21/Pinocchio-s-Nose/blob/main/Resnet50_Usage.ipynb)**  
  Demonstrates how to load and use the trained ResNet50 model for inference on new images.

- **[CNN_Training.ipynb](https://github.com/Visheshh21/Pinocchio-s-Nose/blob/main/CNN_Training.ipynb)**  
  Builds and trains a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for binary classification of fake vs. real images.

- **[CNN_Usage_ui.py](https://github.com/Visheshh21/Pinocchio-s-Nose/blob/main/CNN_Usage_ui.py)**  
  Implements a simple UI to upload images and get predictions from the trained CNN model.

- **[VulgarVeto.py](https://github.com/Visheshh21/Pinocchio-s-Nose/blob/main/VulgarVeto.PY)**  
  Filters and flags profane language in audio content using speech recognition and text analysis.


#### üñãÔ∏è **Key Capabilities**
- Image preprocessing and data augmentation techniques
- Comprehensive model performance monitoring
- Cutting-edge machine learning approaches to combat digital manipulation
- Supports audio file input
- Converts speech to text

## üîÆ Future Scope

#### **For Pinocchio‚Äôs Nose:**
- Implement **EfficientNetB7, or Vision Transformer** as the classifier for better detection performance.
#### **For VulgarVeto:**
- Integrate speech recognition models like **Wav2Vec2 or Whisper (OpenAI)** for advanced speech-to-text capabilities.
- Use **SpeechT5 (Microsoft) or F5** as a text-to-speech tool for improved translation of machine language to audio.

## üéØ Mission
Promoting responsible technology use and creating safer digital communities by providing intelligent, user-centric content moderation tools.
